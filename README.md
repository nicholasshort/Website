# Website

My personal website is currently running on a VM hosted by Linode. 

It is accessible here: http://nicholasshort.com/

I have programmed a very basic HTTP webserver that uses the python http package. Additionally, using Github's API, I have created a small wrapper to get repository names and readme data which is then presented on the projects tab of my website.
